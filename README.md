# Project "Smart 3D printer using DE10-Nano HPS/FPGA"

Purpose: to create a 3D printer that helps to prevent failures and problems during a printing progress, to have a user-friendly control interface (LCD display), an isolated body and a large printing area.

Applications: The scope of 3D printers application is wide. We use SoC to provide functioning of the printer with advanced features. SoC is used to generate signals for the mechanical parts of the printer, to realize high-level information processing algorithms, and to provide the interaction interface to users.

Target user: This product is a prototype of future 3D printers on SoC. At present, there are no similar products in the middle price segment. Our team presents a new concept of a printer control system which provides a convenient user interface with the possibility of further connection to smart home systems using IoT technology.
